# What is it all about?
Before we start, let's ask ourselves a few questions. Why do we learn programming? What do I want to build? How did the word *programming* even come to my mind? Please take a moment to answer these questions in your mind before moving to the next section. 

Now, let's answer these questions together. The reason we might learn programming might be to build a cool program for our computer. For example, I might want to develop a program that will organize all the movies on my laptop based on their genre and keep track of which ones I've watched and when. Plus, it could do other cool things with my movie collection. Lastly, I might have heard about programming from friends, the internet or a school book.

The answer to these questions could be different for everyone but they all follow the same pattern. We must have our own answers to these questions otherwise reading all these things might lead to frustration or disappointment.

After answering these questions, you might be asking yourself, "How can I build a computer program?" The answer is simple: with Python. Now let's do some programming, eh?

## What is Python?

## Let do this anyway

### What do you need?
### Installing Python
### Installing VS Code
### Write our first program
### Run our first program
### What happened?

## What did we just do?
