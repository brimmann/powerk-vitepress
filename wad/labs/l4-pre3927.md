## Procedural Task
The following tasks are provided with proper instruction, the task is marked correct as long as you follow the instructions. Do not copy code, instead write it so you can understand the whole concept. This is essential for your exploratory tasks, quizzes, assignments and exams.

### Task 1: Background Image
#### Objective
Explore the idea of background image and its related CSS rules.

#### Setup
Create a new HTML file (`index-p-task1.html`) and a CSS file (`styles-p-task1.css`). Link `styles-p-task1.css` to `index-p-task1.html`.

---

##### Step 1: Basic HTML Structure
First, let's make a simple HTML file to apply the CSS:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Background Image Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="background-container">
        <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
        <p>This is a sample page with a background image.</p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the `<div class="background-container">` will have our background image.

##### Step 2: Adding the Background Image in CSS
Create a `style.css` file and add the following code:

```css
.background-container {
    /* Add your background image */
    background-image: url('path/to/your-image.jpg'); /* replace with your image path */
    
    /* Make the image cover the entire container */
    background-size: cover;

    /* Center the image */
    background-position: center;

    /* Make it stay in place while scrolling */
    background-attachment: fixed;

    /* Set the height of the container */
    height: 100vh; /* or use any height you want */

    /* Optional: Add some padding to position text nicely */
    padding: 20px;
    color: white;
}
```

##### Step 3: Understanding Each Property
- `background-image`: Specifies the image. Replace `path/to/your-image.jpg` with the location of your image.
- `background-size: cover`: Scales the image to cover the entire container area.
- `background-position: center`: Centers the image within the container.
- `background-attachment: fixed`: Keeps the image in place as you scroll.
- `height: 100vh`: Sets the container height to the full viewport height, so it fills the screen.

##### Step 4 (optional): Experiment and Observe
In this step try different related properties and see how everything works together.


### Task 2: Overflow
#### Objective
Explore the idea of overflow and how it is used.

#### Setup
Create a new HTML file (`index-p-task2.html`) and a CSS file (`styles-p-task2.css`). Link `styles-p-task2.css` to `index-p-task2.html`.

---
##### Step 1: Basic HTML Structure
Let’s set up a simple HTML structure to test the `overflow` property:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>CSS Overflow Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Overflow Example</h1>
        <p>
            This is some text inside a container that has limited width and height.
            If the text is too long to fit, we will see how the `overflow` property
            controls its visibility and appearance.
        </p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

##### Step 2: Basic CSS Setup for the Container
Create a `style.css` file with the following code to add a defined size for the `.container` and style the overflow:

```css
.container {
    width: 200px;
    height: 100px;
    border: 2px solid #333;
    padding: 10px;
    overflow: hidden; /* default setting */
}
```

With this, our container is limited to `200px` in width and `100px` in height. Anything that exceeds these boundaries will be affected by the `overflow` property.

##### Step 3: Using Different Overflow Values
Now, let’s explore the different `overflow` values:

###### 1. `overflow: visible;`
This is the default setting for overflow. Content will simply extend beyond the container, which might not look neat if there’s too much text or other elements.

```css
.container {
    overflow: visible;
}
```

###### 2. `overflow: hidden;`
This will hide any content that goes beyond the container’s boundaries. Only the content within the defined width and height will be visible.

```css
.container {
    overflow: hidden;
}
```

###### 3. `overflow: scroll;`
This forces a scrollbar to appear, even if the content fits within the container. Both horizontal and vertical scrollbars will show up, allowing users to scroll to see the overflowing content.

```css
.container {
    overflow: scroll;
}
```

###### 4. `overflow: auto;`
With `auto`, scrollbars will appear only if the content exceeds the container’s size. This is a good choice if you want scrollbars only when they’re needed.

```css
.container {
    overflow: auto;
}
```

###### 5. `overflow-x` and `overflow-y`
You can control overflow separately for the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) directions using `overflow-x` and `overflow-y`. For example, if you only want vertical scrolling:

```css
.container {
    overflow-x: hidden;
    overflow-y: scroll;
}
```

##### Step 4: Try It Out
- Apply different `overflow` settings in your CSS, save, and refresh the HTML file in a browser to see how each value behaves.


### Task 3: `float` Property in CSS
#### Objective
Explore and understand float property in CSS.

#### Setup
Create a new HTML file (`index-p-task3.html`) and a CSS file (`styles-p-task3.css`). Link `styles-p-task3.css` to `index-p-task3.html`.

---
##### Step 1: Basic HTML Structure
First, let’s create some HTML with multiple elements to see how `float` works.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>CSS Float Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="box box1">Box 1</div>
        <div class="box box2">Box 2</div>
        <div class="box box3">Box 3</div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Each `div` with the class `box` will represent an element we want to float.

##### Step 2: Basic CSS Styling for the Boxes
Create a `style.css` file and add styling for the `.box` elements to make them stand out:

```css
.container {
    width: 100%;
    border: 2px solid #333;
    padding: 10px;
}

.box {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    margin: 5px;
    color: white;
    text-align: center;
    line-height: 100px;
    font-weight: bold;
}

.box1 { background-color: #3498db; }
.box2 { background-color: #e74c3c; }
.box3 { background-color: #2ecc71; }
```

This makes each `.box` have a color, fixed width, and height so we can clearly see the floating effects.

##### Step 3: Applying the Float Property
Now, let’s see how different values of `float` affect the layout.

###### 1. `float: left;`
This aligns elements to the left side of their container, allowing elements that follow to wrap around on the right.

```css
.box {
    float: left;
}
```

In this case, all `.box` elements will align horizontally to the left within the container.

###### 2. `float: right;`
This aligns elements to the right side of their container, allowing elements that follow to wrap around on the left.

```css
.box {
    float: right;
}
```

With this, all `.box` elements will align horizontally to the right.

##### Step 4: Clearing Floats
When you use `float`, the parent container may not fully wrap around the floated elements. To fix this, you can "clear" the floats.

Add a `clearfix` class to the container:

```css
.container::after {
    content: "";
    display: table;
    clear: both;
}
```

This trick forces the container to expand to fit all floated elements inside.

##### Step 5: Try It Out
- Try floating `.box` elements to the left or right, and experiment with clearing the floats in the `.container` to see how it affects the layout.

And that’s it! Now you have a handle on the basics of using `float` in CSS

### Task 4: Positioning in CSS
#### Objective
In this task you will explore the idea of how to use different types of positioning in CSS.

#### Setup
Create a new HTML file (`index-p-task4.html`) and a CSS file (`styles-p-task4.css`). Link `styles-p-task4.css` to `index-p-task4.html`.

---

##### Step 1: Basic HTML Structure
We’ll set up a basic HTML structure with multiple elements to apply different positioning styles.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>CSS Positioning Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="box static">Static Position</div>
        <div class="box relative">Relative Position</div>
        <div class="box absolute">Absolute Position</div>
        <div class="box fixed">Fixed Position</div>
        <div class="box sticky">Sticky Position</div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Each `div` with the class `box` will represent an element we’ll position.

##### Step 2: Basic CSS Styling
Create a `style.css` file and add some basic styling to see each positioning type clearly.

```css
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

.container {
    height: 1200px; /* to test scrolling with sticky and fixed */
    padding: 20px;
}

.box {
    width: 200px;
    height: 100px;
    margin: 20px 0;
    padding: 10px;
    color: white;
    text-align: center;
    font-weight: bold;
}

.static { background-color: #3498db; }
.relative { background-color: #e74c3c; }
.absolute { background-color: #2ecc71; }
.fixed { background-color: #f1c40f; }
.sticky { background-color: #9b59b6; }
```

Now, let’s apply different positioning styles.

##### Step 3: CSS Positioning Types

###### 1. `position: static;`
This is the default setting for all elements. Elements with `static` positioning appear in the normal document flow. They can’t be offset with `top`, `right`, `bottom`, or `left`.

```css
.static {
    position: static;
}
```

###### 2. `position: relative;`
This positions the element relative to its original place in the document. You can adjust its location using `top`, `right`, `bottom`, or `left`, without affecting the surrounding elements.

```css
.relative {
    position: relative;
    top: 20px;
    left: 20px;
}
```

###### 3. `position: absolute;`
An `absolute` element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned (non-static) ancestor. If there’s none, it’s positioned relative to the document. It’s removed from the normal document flow, so it doesn’t affect other elements.

```css
.absolute {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50px;
    left: 50px;
}
```

###### 4. `position: fixed;`
This fixes the element to the viewport, meaning it will stay in the same position even as you scroll. Useful for headers, footers, or side menus that should always be visible.

```css
.fixed {
    position: fixed;
    top: 10px;
    right: 10px;
}
```

###### 5. `position: sticky;`
A `sticky` element toggles between `relative` and `fixed` positioning based on the scroll position. It acts as `relative` until you scroll past a certain point, then it becomes `fixed`.

```css
.sticky {
    position: sticky;
    top: 0; /* becomes fixed when scrolled to the top of the container */
}
```

##### Step 4: Try It Out
- Open the HTML file in a browser, and scroll to see the `fixed` and `sticky` positions in action.
- Adjust the `top`, `left`, `right`, or `bottom` values to see how each position type affects element layout.

Alright, Rush! Let’s dive into a quick guide on overlapping and hiding elements in CSS.

### Task 5: Overlapping and Hiding Elements
#### Objective
Explore methods on how to overlap one element over another or how to hide an element using css.

#### Setup
Create a new HTML file (`index-p-task5.html`) and a CSS file (`styles-p-task5.css`). Link `styles-p-task5.css` to `index-p-task5.html`.

---

##### Step 1: Basic HTML Structure
Let’s set up a simple HTML structure with multiple elements to play around with overlapping and hiding.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>CSS Overlapping and Hiding</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="box box1">Box 1</div>
    <div class="box box2">Box 2</div>
    <div class="box box3">Box 3</div>
</body>
</html>
```

Each `div` with the class `box` will be used to demonstrate overlapping and hiding techniques.

##### Step 2: Basic CSS Styling
Create a `style.css` file to style each box for visibility:

```css
body {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
    margin: 0;
}

.box {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    color: white;
    font-weight: bold;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    position: absolute; /* allows overlap */
}

.box1 {
    background-color: #3498db;
    z-index: 1;
}

.box2 {
    background-color: #e74c3c;
    left: 50px; /* move it slightly to create overlap */
    top: 20px;
    z-index: 2;
}

.box3 {
    background-color: #2ecc71;
    left: 100px;
    top: 40px;
    z-index: 3;
}
```

This CSS positions each `.box` absolutely and uses the `z-index` property to control their stacking order.

##### Step 3: Overlapping with `z-index`
The `z-index` property controls which element appears on top. Higher `z-index` values mean the element is closer to the front. In our example:
- `.box3` (green) has the highest `z-index` (3) and will be in front.
- `.box2` (red) has a `z-index` of 2 and will be in the middle.
- `.box1` (blue) has a `z-index` of 1 and will be at the back.

This setup will create a layered overlap, with each box slightly shifted.

##### Step 4: Hiding Elements
To hide elements, you can use the following CSS properties:

##### 1. `display: none;`
This completely removes the element from the document flow, making it invisible and not occupying any space.

```css
.box2 {
    display: none;
}
```

###### 2. `visibility: hidden;`
This makes the element invisible, but it still occupies space in the document flow.

```css
.box2 {
    visibility: hidden;
}
```

###### 3. `opacity: 0;`
This makes the element fully transparent (invisible) but still clickable and occupying space.

```css
.box2 {
    opacity: 0;
}
```

##### Step 5: Try It Out
- Experiment by adding `display: none;`, `visibility: hidden;`, or `opacity: 0;` to `.box2` in your CSS and see how it affects the layout.


## Exploratory Tasks
Read the problem statements and solve them accordingly using your own understanding.

### Task 1: Background Image
**Problem Statement**: Create a simple webpage with a full-page background image of your choice. The background image should cover the entire viewport and stay centered, regardless of screen size. Add some text on top of the background image that remains readable.

---

### Task 2: Overflow
**Problem Statement**: Create a container `div` with fixed dimensions (e.g., 200px by 100px) and add some text that will overflow the box. Experiment with the `overflow` property by setting it to `hidden`, `scroll`, and `auto` in different steps to see how it changes the appearance. Add a title to describe each version of `overflow` you applied.

---

### Task 3: Float Property in CSS
**Problem Statement**: Design a layout with three boxes next to each other inside a container. Use the `float` property to align the first box to the left, the second box to the right, and leave the third box in the center. Clear the floats to ensure the container wraps around all three boxes properly.

---

### Task 4: Positioning in CSS
**Problem Statement**: Create four boxes labeled **Static**, **Relative**, **Absolute**, and **Fixed**. Apply each positioning type to its corresponding box and use the `top`, `left`, `bottom`, or `right` properties to place them differently. For the **Fixed** box, ensure it stays at the bottom-right corner of the viewport when you scroll.

---

### Task 5: Overlapping and Hiding Elements
**Problem Statement**: Create three overlapping boxes with different colors and `z-index` values to create a layered effect. Make sure the box with the highest `z-index` appears on top. Add a button that, when clicked, hides the top box using `display: none;` and then reveals it again if clicked a second time.
