# Lab Task 11 - Creating a Complete Website

In this lab task, you will build a complete website using the skills you have learned in this course. Make sure your design is unique. Do not copy code from others or from online sources, and do not copy each other’s projects. You may have to explain your work in a viva, so be prepared from the start.

## Project Title
**Interactive Personal Portfolio Website**

## Project Goal

Create a single-page portfolio website that showcases a personal (or fictional) profile, skills, and projects, while incorporating visually appealing design and interactive elements. The site must be responsive, well-structured, and styled thoroughly with CSS, and it must include multiple JavaScript-driven features.

## Mandatory Features and Requirements

### 1. File and Folder Structure

- Create a main project folder named `portfolio-site` (or a similar clear name).
- Inside this folder, have:
    - `index.html`
    - `styles.css`
    - `script.js`
    - An `images` folder (for logos, placeholders, etc.)—even if you use placeholder images.

### 2. HTML Structure

1. **Header & Navigation**
    
    - Must include a recognizable, styled header with a site logo or text-based branding.
    - Must have a navigation bar with distinct links (e.g., “Home,” “About,” “Projects,” “Contact”).
    - Use semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`.
2. **Hero Section**
    
    - Place a prominent hero section near the top, including:
        - A large heading or tagline (e.g., “Welcome to My Portfolio”).
        - A background image or a visually striking color gradient.
        - A short paragraph or call-to-action button that links to another section.
3. **About Section**
    
    - Provide information about yourself or a fictional persona (name, brief background, interests).
    - Include at least one real or placeholder image (e.g., profile photo).
    - Use proper headings and paragraphs for structure.
4. **Skills/Services Section**
    
    - Showcase at least **three** skills or services.
    - Each skill must have:
        - A short title (e.g., “Web Development”)
        - A brief description (1–3 lines).
        - An icon or small representative image if possible.
5. **Projects Section**
    
    - Must include at least **three** projects.
    - Each project must contain:
        - Project name/title
        - Image (placeholder or real screenshot)
        - Short description (1–3 lines)
        - A button or link that hypothetically leads to a live demo or GitHub repo.
6. **Contact Section**
    
    - Must contain a working contact form that collects:
        - Name (required)
        - Email (required)
        - Message (required)
    - Use basic form validation (e.g., alert the user if required fields are empty).
    - Include clear labels for each field.
7. **Footer**
    
    - A simple footer with basic info or copyright notice (e.g., “© 202X Your Name”).
    - Optionally, include social media icons or links.

### 3. CSS Styling

1. **Consistent Theme & Color Palette**
    
    - Select a coherent color scheme (2–4 colors) and use it site-wide.
    - Ensure text is easy to read (pay attention to contrast).
2. **Typography**
    
    - Use at least two distinct font families (e.g., one for headings, one for body text).
    - Style headings to be visually different from body text.
    - Maintain consistent font sizes for headings (e.g., H1 > H2 > H3).
3. **Layout & Responsiveness**
    
    - Use **Flexbox** or **CSS Grid** for layouts (header, hero, project cards, etc.).
    - The site must be **responsive**:
        - Columns should wrap or adjust on smaller screens.
        - Navigation must remain accessible and clear on mobile devices.
4. **Hover Effects & Transitions**
    
    - Include at least **two** hover effects (e.g., for buttons or images).
    - Include CSS transitions or animations on some interactive elements (e.g., links growing in size or changing color on hover).
5. **Dark/Light Mode Styling**
    
    - Must implement a **dark mode** toggle that changes the color scheme.
    - Use a CSS class like `.dark-theme` on the body or a root container.
    - Ensure text, background, and other elements remain legible in both modes.

### 4. JavaScript Interactivity

1. **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**
    
    - A button or switch that adds/removes a `.dark-theme` class from the `<body>` or main container.
    - Save the user’s preference in `localStorage` or revert to default on page reload.
2. **Collapsible Section or Accordion**
    
    - At least one section (e.g., an “FAQ” or “More Info” segment in the “About” or “Projects” section) must be collapsible.
    - A button or clickable heading toggles visibility of the content.
3. **Interactive Contact Form**
    
    - Validate name, email, and message fields.
    - When the form is successfully submitted, display a success message (e.g., in a modal or as a text update on the page).
    - If fields are invalid, display clear error messages.
4. **Smooth Scrolling & Scroll-Triggered Effects**
    
    - Navigation links to sections of the same page should use smooth scrolling.
    - Implement a basic scroll-triggered effect (e.g., fade in or slide in for a section as the user scrolls).
5. **Additional Interactive Feature (Choose at least one)**
    
    - **Image Carousel**: A small slider with previous/next controls to cycle through images.
    - **Modal Popup**: A button that opens a modal overlay with extra info or an enlarged project image.
    - **Simple To-Do List**: An area in the site where users can add/remove items (e.g., project tasks or personal notes).

### 5. Code Quality

1. **Semantic HTML**
    
    - Use semantic tags (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`) where applicable.
    - Ensure each section has a heading and is well-structured.
2. **External Files & Linking**
    
    - Separate your CSS (`styles.css`) and JavaScript (`script.js`) from the HTML.
    - Use consistent naming conventions for classes and IDs.
3. **Comments & Readability**
    
    - Comment your code to explain key parts (especially JavaScript functions or complex CSS sections).
    - Properly indent and space your HTML, CSS, and JS for readability.
4. **Performance Considerations**
    
    - Use optimized images or placeholders (avoid extremely large file sizes).
    - Keep inline styles to a minimum (prefer classes in external CSS).

### 6. Final Polish & Presentation

1. **Testing**
    
    - Check in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) if possible.
    - Test on mobile devices or at least use your browser’s responsive design mode.
2. **Deployment or Demonstration**
    
    - Provide a live demo URL (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static hosting service) **OR**
    - Present it locally, but ensure all external links and scripts function correctly.
3. **Screenshot or Video Preview**
    
    - Provide at least one screenshot or a short screencast demonstrating the site’s appearance and interactions.
