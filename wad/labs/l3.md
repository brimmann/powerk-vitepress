</body>
</html>
```

---

### **Step 2: CSS Styling with Attribute Selectors**

In `styles.css`, use different types of CSS attribute selectors to style the elements. Follow each of the examples below.

---

1. **Basic Attribute Selector**  
   Style all elements with a `data-available` attribute:
   ```css
   [data-available] {
     font-weight: bold;
     color: #333;
   }
   ```

2. **Exact Attribute Value Selector**  
   Target only elements where `data-available` is `true`:
   ```css
   [data-available="true"] {
     color: green;
   }
   ```

3. **Partial Attribute Selector (`^=`)**  
   Target all links (`<a>`) where the `href` starts with `https`:
   ```css
   a[href^="https"] {
     color: blue;
     text-decoration: underline;
   }
   ```

4. **Partial Attribute Selector (`$=`)**  
   Target all links where `href` ends with `.com`:
   ```css
   a[href$=".com"] {
     background-color: #f0f0f0;
     padding: 5px;
     border-radius: 3px;
   }
   ```

5. **Substring Attribute Selector (`*=`)**  
   Target all links where `title` contains the word `Visit`:
   ```css
   a[title*="Visit"] {
     color: red;
     font-style: italic;
   }
   ```

6. **Multiple Attribute Selectors**  
   Target only products in the `electronics` category that are `available`:
   ```css
   .product[data-category="electronics"][data-available="true"] {
     border: 2px solid blue;
     padding: 10px;
   }
   ```

---

### **Step 3: Experiment and Observe**

1. **Test Each Selector:**  
   Open `index.html` in your browser and observe how each selector affects the styling of the elements.

2. **Add More Elements and Attributes:**  
   Add a few more products or links to see how the selectors apply to new elements. Try changing some attributes in `index.html` to see how the CSS adjusts.

3. **Optional Challenges:**  
   - Create a selector to style links that contain a specific email domain (e.g., `example.com`).
   - Target products in the `clothing` category that are `not available` and style them differently.

   .btn:hover::after {
     content: " ➔";
     color: #fff;
     padding-left: 8px;
     transition: padding-left 0.3s ease;
   }
   ```

5. **Creating a Custom Button Effect with `::before`**  
   Add a gradient background effect behind `.btn` using `::before`:
   ```css
   .btn::before {
     content: "";
     position: absolute;
     top: 0;
     left: 0;
     right: 0;
     bottom: 0;
     background: linear-gradient(135deg, #ff7e5f, #feb47b);
     z-index: -1;
     border-radius: 5px;
     transition: opacity 0.3s ease;
   }
   
   /* Make sure the button's text is on top of the gradient */
   .btn {
     position: relative;
     color: #fff;
     padding: 10px 20px;
     font-weight: bold;
     background: none;
     border: none;
     cursor: pointer;
   }
   
   /* Hide the background gradient until hover */
   .btn:hover::before {
     opacity: 1;
   }
   ```

---

### **Step 3: Experiment and Observe**

1. **Test Each Selector:**  
   Open `index.html` in your browser and check out each pseudo-element effect.

2. **Modify Content:**  
   Try changing the `.quote` text or adding a new `description` paragraph to see how the pseudo-elements apply to new content.

3. **Optional Challenge:**  
   - Use `::before` and `::after` to create a ribbon effect around the `h1` tag.
   - Try combining `::first-line` and `::first-letter` on a new paragraph to create a stylish intro effect.

## **Procedural Task 4: CSS Contextual Selector**

#### **Objective:**
Learn to use CSS contextual selectors (descendant, child, adjacent sibling, and general sibling) to style elements based on their relationships in the document structure.

#### **Setup:**
Create a new HTML file (`index.html`) and a CSS file (`styles.css`). Link `styles.css` to `index.html`.

---

### **Step 1: HTML Structure**

Write the following HTML structure into your `index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>CSS Contextual Selector Lab</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="main">
    <h1>Welcome to the Contextual Selector Lab</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Content Section</h2>
      <p>This paragraph is inside the content section.</p>
      <p>This paragraph is also inside the content section.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sidebar">
      <h2>Sidebar Section</h2>
      <p>This paragraph is inside the sidebar.</p>
      <p>This paragraph is also inside the sidebar.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="footer">
      <h2>Footer Section</h2>
      <p>This paragraph is inside the footer.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>Some Headline</h3>
  <p>This paragraph follows a headline.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

---

### **Step 2: CSS Styling with Contextual Selectors**

In `styles.css`, use different contextual selectors to style elements based on their relationships. Follow each example below.

---

1. **Descendant Selector**  
   Target all `<p>` elements inside `.content` and style them:
   ```css
   .content p {
     color: darkblue;
     font-style: italic;
   }
   ```

2. **Child Selector (`>`)**  
   Style only the direct child `<h2>` elements of `.main` (not any nested inside further levels):
   ```css
   .main > h2 {
     color: darkred;
   }
   ```

3. **Adjacent Sibling Selector (`+`)**  
   Style the first `<p>` element immediately following an `<h3>`:
   ```css
   h3 + p {
     background-color: #f0f0f0;
     padding: 10px;
     border-left: 3px solid #333;
   }
   ```

4. **General Sibling Selector (`~`)**  
   Style all `<p>` elements that follow an `<h2>` in the `.sidebar` (including non-adjacent ones):
   ```css
   .sidebar h2 ~ p {
     color: green;
     font-weight: bold;
   }
   ```

5. **Combination of Descendant and Child Selectors**  
   Style only `<p>` elements that are direct children of `.footer` within `.main`:
   ```css
   .main > .footer > p {
     color: #555;
     font-size: 1.1em;
   }
   ```

---

### **Step 3: Experiment and Observe**

1. **Test Each Selector:**  
   Open `index.html` in your browser and observe how each selector applies to the elements in the HTML structure.

2. **Modify Content:**  
   Add additional paragraphs and headings within `.content`, `.sidebar`, and `.footer` to see how the contextual selectors behave.

3. **Optional Challenges:**  
   - Add another `<h3>` in `.content` and style the first `<p>` after it using the adjacent sibling selector.
   - Use a descendant selector to target all `<h2>` elements inside `.main`, regardless of their nested level, and apply a unique font style.

---

### **What to Submit:**

After completing the task, submit:
- A screenshot of the final rendered HTML page showing all contextual selector effects.
- Your `styles.css` file with the contextual selector code.

---



## **Procedural Task 5: CSS Cascade Lab Task**

#### **Objective:**
Learn how the CSS cascade works by observing how different styles are applied based on specificity, importance, and the order of rules.

#### **Setup:**
Create a new HTML file (`index.html`) and a CSS file (`styles.css`). Link `styles.css` to `index.html`.

---

### **Step 1: HTML Structure**

Write the following HTML structure into your `index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>CSS Cascade Lab</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1 class="title">CSS Cascade Demonstration</h1>
  
  <div class="content">
    <p>This is a paragraph inside the content section.</p>
    <p class="highlighted">This is a highlighted paragraph inside the content section.</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph in the content section.</p>
  </div>
  
  <footer class="footer">
    <p>This is a paragraph in the footer section.</p>
  </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

---

### **Step 2: CSS Styling with Cascade Rules**

In `styles.css`, add rules to explore the effects of specificity, importance, and order.

---

1. **Basic Styling**  
   Apply some general styling for all `<p>` tags:
   ```css
   p {
     color: #333;
     font-size: 16px;
   }
   ```

2. **Class Selector**  
   Add a style to the `.highlighted` class to make this paragraph stand out:
   ```css
   .highlighted {
     color: darkorange;
     font-weight: bold;
   }
   ```

3. **More Specific Selector (Class + Element)**  
   Target only `<p>` elements with the class `.highlighted` inside `.content` and change the color:
   ```css
   .content p.highlighted {
     color: teal;
   }
   ```

4. **Order of Rules**  
   Add another rule for `.highlighted` but place it *after* the previous one to see how order affects the cascade:
   ```css
   .highlighted {
     color: purple;
   }
   ```

5. **Using `!important`**  
   Force the color of `.highlighted` to blue using `!important`:
   ```css
   .highlighted {
     color: blue !important;
   }
   ```

6. **Inline Style (Observe Specificity Override)**  
   Add an inline style to the first `<p>` element in `index.html` for extra specificity. Add the following inline style directly in the HTML:
   ```html
   <p style="color: red;">This is a paragraph inside the content section.</p>
   ```

---

### **Step 3: Experiment and Observe**

1. **Observe the Cascade Rules:**  
   Open `index.html` in your browser and note how each rule is applied. Notice how `!important`, specificity, and order affect the final styling.

2. **Modify Selectors:**  
   Experiment by removing the `!important` rule or reordering the CSS rules to see how the cascade adjusts the styles.

3. **Optional Challenges:**  
   - Add an `id` to one of the paragraphs and style it with an `id` selector to see how it overrides class and element selectors.
   - Add another rule with `!important` for `.footer p` and observe how it behaves compared to other rules.

---

### **What to Submit:**

After completing the task, submit:
- A screenshot of the final rendered HTML page showing the effect of cascade rules.
- Your `styles.css` file with the cascade rules.

# **Exploratory Tasks**

Read the problem statements and solve them accordingly using your own understanding.
## **Exploratory Task 1: CSS Attribute Selector**

**Problem Statement:**

Create a list of book titles in an HTML page, each with attributes like `data-genre`, `data-author`, and `data-available`. Add links to purchase or learn more about each book with `href` and `title` attributes. Use CSS attribute selectors to style books based on their genre (e.g., mystery, romance, science-fiction), availability, or author, and apply specific styles to links based on URL patterns or titles. Experiment with `[attribute]`, `[attribute="value"]`, `[attribute^="value"]`, `[attribute$="value"]`, and `[attribute*="value"]` selectors to visually differentiate each category or attribute.

---

## **Exploratory Task 2: CSS Pseudo-Element Selector**

**Problem Statement:**

Design a small HTML page with a welcome message, a section of user comments, and a "Submit" button. Use pseudo-elements like `::before`, `::after`, `::first-line`, and `::first-letter` to add creative touches. For example, add a decorative symbol before each comment, style the first line of the welcome message uniquely, and make the first letter of each comment larger and bold. On the "Submit" button, add a hover effect that shows a subtle icon after the text when hovered. Try using pseudo-elements to add these design details without altering the HTML structure.

---

## **Exploratory Task 3: CSS Pseudo-Class Selector**

**Problem Statement:**

Create an HTML document with a simple navigation menu, a section with a list of announcements, and a "Subscribe" button. Use CSS pseudo-classes like `:hover`, `:nth-child`, `:first-child`, `:not()`, and `:focus` to style each section. For example, add a color change effect when hovering over menu items, apply alternating background colors to the announcement items, and change the "Subscribe" button style when it’s in focus or hovered. Use pseudo-classes to create dynamic styles based on interaction and element order within each section.

---

## **Exploratory Task 4: CSS Contextual Selector**

**Problem Statement:**

Design an HTML structure with a blog section that includes a main article, a sidebar, and a footer with related links. Include headings and multiple paragraphs within each section. Use contextual selectors—such as descendant selectors, child selectors (`>`), adjacent sibling selectors (`+`), and general sibling selectors (`~`)—to style the elements based on their positions. For example, style only the direct child headings of the main article, change the appearance of paragraphs that immediately follow a heading, and apply unique styles to links in the footer based on their relationships to other elements. Experiment with these contextual relationships to target elements precisely.

---

## **Exploratory Task 5: CSS Cascade**

**Problem Statement:**

Create a simple HTML page with a heading, an information card with a few lines of text, and a footer message. Write CSS rules with varying specificity levels, including element selectors, class selectors, and combined selectors. Add an inline style to one line of the information card and use `!important` on one of the footer styles to explore the impact of these on the cascade. Test different combinations of specificity, order of rules, and `!important` to see how they affect the styling hierarchy and final appearance of each section.
