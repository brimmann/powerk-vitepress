# Introduction to BOM

The **Browser Object Model (BOM)** gives developers access to the browser’s features beyond just the web page’s content. Unlike the **Document Object Model (DOM)**, which focuses on the structure and content of a web page, the BOM deals with the browser window and its various operations—like manipulating windows, navigating history, and working with the address bar.

## Section 1: Window Properties

### innerHeight

- **Purpose**: Returns the height of the browser’s visible content area (viewport) in pixels.
- **Example**:
    
    ```js
    const viewportHeight = window.innerHeight;
    console.log(`Viewport height: ${viewportHeight}px`);
    ```
    

### innerWidth

- **Purpose**: Returns the width of the browser’s visible content area (viewport) in pixels.
- **Example**:
    
    ```js
    const viewportWidth = window.innerWidth;
    console.log(`Viewport width: ${viewportWidth}px`);
    ```

## Section 2: Window Manipulation Methods

### open()

- **Purpose**: Opens a new browser window or tab.
- **Basic Example**:
    
    ```js
    // Opens a new tab or window (depending on the browser settings)
    const newWindow = window.open('https://example.com', '_blank');
    ```
    

### close()

- **Purpose**: Closes the current window or a window opened via `window.open()`.
- **Note**: Browsers often **restrict** closing windows/tabs that weren’t opened by your script for security reasons.
- **Example**:
    
    ```js
    // Close a previously opened window
    newWindow.close();
    ```
    

### resizeBy() and resizeTo()

- **resizeBy()**: Resizes the window **relative** to its current size.
    
    ```js
    // Increase the window width by 100px and height by 50px
    window.resizeBy(100, 50);
    ```
    
- **resizeTo()**: Resizes the window to a **specific** width and height.
    
    ```js
    // Set the window size to 800px by 600px
    window.resizeTo(800, 600);
    ```
    

### moveBy() and moveTo()

- **moveBy()**: Moves the window **relative** to its current position.
    
    ```js
    // Move the window 50px to the right and 20px down
    window.moveBy(50, 20);
    ```
    
- **moveTo()**: Moves the window to a **specific** coordinate on the screen.
    
    ```js
    // Move the window to the top-left corner of the screen
    window.moveTo(0, 0);
    ```

## Section 3: Navigating History

### history

The **history** object lets you navigate the browser’s session history.

- **back()**: Moves one step backward in history.
    
    ```js
    window.history.back();
    ```
    
- **forward()**: Moves one step forward in history.
    
    ```js
    window.history.forward();
    ```
    
- **go()**: Moves a specific number of pages in history (negative for back, positive for forward).
    
    ```js
    // Go back 2 pages
    window.history.go(-2);
    // Go forward 1 page
    window.history.go(1);
    ```
    

---

## Section 4: Scrolling Methods

### scroll()

- **Purpose**: Scrolls the window to a specified position. Accepts either x/y coordinates or an options object.
- **Example**:
    
    ```js
    // Scroll to x=0, y=500
    window.scroll({ top: 500, left: 0, behavior: 'smooth' });
    ```
    

### scrollTo()

- **Purpose**: Essentially the same as `scroll()`, but specifically focuses on absolute positions.
- **Example**:
    
    ```js
    // Scroll to x=0, y=300 directly
    window.scrollTo(0, 300);
    ```
    

### scrollBy()

- **Purpose**: Scrolls **relative** to the current position.
- **Example**:
    
    ```js
    // Scroll down by 100px from the current position
    window.scrollBy(0, 100);
    ```

## Section 5: Working with the Location Object

### location

The **location** object holds information about the current URL and allows navigation.

- **Key Properties**:
    - `location.href` – Full URL of the current page.
    - `location.hostname` – The domain name of the web host (e.g., `example.com`).
    - `location.pathname` – The path after the hostname (e.g., `/about`).
- **Basic Methods**:
    - **reload()**: Reloads the current page.
        
        ```js
        location.reload();
        ```
        
    - **assign()**: Loads a new document at the provided URL (adds an entry to the session history).
        
        ```js
        location.assign('https://example.com');
        ```

## Section 6: Utility Methods

### print()

- **Purpose**: Opens the browser’s print dialog for the current page.
- **Example**:
    
    ```js
    window.print();
    ```

## Conclusion

In this guide, we explored the **Browser Object Model (BOM)** basics, including:

- How to access viewport dimensions.
- Manipulate browser windows (open, close, move, and resize).
- Navigate through browser history.
- Scroll pages programmatically.
- Work with the location object to read or change the URL.
- Trigger the print dialog.

Learning the BOM helps you add interactive features to your web applications and control the browser environment effectively. Mastering these basics will enhance the user experience and give you greater control over how your web application behaves in the browser.

##  Exercises

Try these short exercises to practice the BOM features:

1. **Viewport Size Checker**
    
    - Create a small script that logs `window.innerWidth` and `window.innerHeight` whenever the user resizes the window.
    - Hint: Use the `resize` event on `window` and check the updated sizes in the event handler.
2. **Window Resizing and Moving**
    
    - Open a new window (e.g., a blank page) using `window.open()`.
    - Resize it to 600px by 400px using `resizeTo()`.
    - Move it to coordinates (200, 100) using `moveTo()`.
3. **Simple History Navigation**
    
    - Add two buttons on a page: one to go back in history and another to go forward.
    - Use `history.back()` and `history.forward()` in their click handlers.
4. **Scrolling to Sections**
    
    - Create a tall page with sections.
    - Add a button that, when clicked, scrolls the page to a specific section using `scrollTo()`.
5. **Location Explorer**
    
    - Log `location.href`, `location.hostname`, and `location.pathname` in the console.
    - Then create a button that uses `location.assign()` to navigate to another website.
6. **Printing the Page**
    
    - Add a “Print” button that calls `window.print()` on click to display the print dialog.

By completing these exercises, you'll get hands-on experience with the BOM and be better equipped to create more interactive and engaging web applications.
