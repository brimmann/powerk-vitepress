# Lab 2 - WAD
This lab is divided into two parts. The first part consists of **Mini Tasks**, which you must complete within the first 15 minutes. Instructions will be provided, and as long as you follow them, the tasks will be considered completed. In the second part, each student will be assigned a section of a webpage design to implement.

**READ THE FOLLOWING NOTE**

You are allowed to use ChatGPT and the internet for assistance. However, do not copy and paste code from other sources. Your code will be used in quizzes, so it's essential that you understand it thoroughly, or you may fail the quizzes.

## Mini Tasks

In these lab mini tasks, you'll explore three fundamental methods to style HTML elements. Each task is self-contained and can be completed independently.

1. **Adding inline styles to elements**
2. **Using the `<style>` tag with class selectors**
3. **Applying styles through an external stylesheet**

## Task 1: How to Add Style to Elements Inline

Inline styles allow you to apply unique styles directly to individual HTML elements using the `style` attribute.

### Steps:

1. **Create a New HTML Document**

   - Open your text editor and create a new file.
   - Set up the basic HTML structure:
     - Start with `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
     - Add `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
     - Within the `<head>` section, include a `<title>` tag (e.g., `<title>Inline Styles Example</title>`).

2. **Add Content to the Body**

   - Inside the `<body>` tags, add some HTML elements such as headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`) and paragraphs (`<p>`).
   - Write some sample text within these elements to see the effects of your styles.

3. **Apply Inline Styles**

   - Choose an element you want to style.
   - Add the `style` attribute directly to the opening tag of that element.
   - Within the `style` attribute, write CSS properties and values. For example:
     - Change text color: `style="color: blue;"`
     - Set font size: `style="font-size: 20px;"`
     - You can include multiple properties by separating them with semicolons, like `style="color: blue; font-size: 20px;"`.

4. **Save and View Your File**

   - Save your file with a `.html` extension, such as `inline-styles.html`.
   - Open the HTML file in a web browser to see the inline styles applied to your elements.

### Exercise:

- **Task:** Apply different inline styles to various elements in your HTML document.
- **Instructions:**
  - Change the background color of a `<div>` using `style="background-color: lightgray;"`.
  - Center-align text within a `<h2>` tag using `style="text-align: center;"`.
  - Experiment with other CSS properties like `border`, `margin`, and `padding` to see how they affect your elements.

## Task 2: How to Use the `<style>` Tag and Select Elements Using Class Selectors

Using the `<style>` tag allows you to define CSS styles within your HTML document. Class selectors enable you to apply the same style to multiple elements by assigning them a common class.

### Steps:

1. **Create a New HTML Document**

   - Open your text editor and create a new file.
   - Set up the basic HTML structure:
     - Start with `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
     - Include `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
     - Add a `<title>` in the `<head>` section (e.g., `<title>Internal Styles with Class Selectors</title>`).

2. **Add the `<style>` Tag Inside `<head>`**

   - Inside the `<head>` section, insert a `<style>` tag to define your CSS rules.
   - The structure should look like this:
     ```html
     <head>
         <title>Your Page Title</title>
         <style>
             /* Your CSS will go here */
         </style>
     </head>
     ```

3. **Define a Class Selector**

   - Inside the `<style>` tag, create a class selector by starting with a period (`.`) followed by the class name (e.g., `.highlight`).
   - Within curly braces `{ }`, define the CSS properties and values you want to apply to this class.
     - For example:
       - Set background color: `background-color: yellow;`
       - Make text bold: `font-weight: bold;`

4. **Add Content to the Body and Assign Classes**

   - In the `<body>` section, add HTML elements like headings and paragraphs.
   - Assign the class to elements by adding the `class` attribute. For example:
     - `<p class="highlight">This is a highlighted paragraph.</p>`
     - `<h2 class="highlight">This is a highlighted heading.</h2>`

5. **Save and View Your File**

   - Save your file with a `.html` extension, such as `class-selectors.html`.
   - Open the HTML file in a web browser to see the styles applied to all elements with the specified class.

### Exercise:

- **Task:** Create and apply class selectors to style multiple elements consistently.
- **Instructions:**
  - Define a new class in the `<style>` tag, such as `.emphasis`, with properties like `color: red;` and `font-style: italic;`.
  - Apply `class="emphasis"` to some of your elements to see the styling effects.
  - Try combining multiple classes on a single element by separating class names with a space, like `class="highlight emphasis"`.

## Task 3: How to Use an External Stylesheet to Style Elements

An external stylesheet allows you to write all your CSS in a separate file, keeping your HTML clean and your styles organized.

### Steps:

1. **Create a New HTML Document**

   - Open your text editor and create a new file.
   - Set up the basic HTML structure:
     - Start with `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
     - Include `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
     - Add a `<title>` in the `<head>` section (e.g., `<title>External Stylesheet Example</title>`).

2. **Create a CSS File**

   - In your text editor, create a new file and save it with a `.css` extension, such as `styles.css`.
   - This file will contain all your CSS rules for this task.

3. **Write CSS Rules in the External File**

   - Open the `styles.css` file.
   - Write CSS selectors and properties to style your HTML elements. For example:
     - Style the `body` element to set a background color.
     - Style `h1` elements to change text color and alignment.
     - Create class selectors (e.g., `.note`) to apply specific styles to elements with that class.

4. **Link the CSS File to Your HTML Document**

   - In the `<head>` section of your HTML file, add a `<link>` tag to connect the CSS file:
     ```html
     <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
     ```
   - Ensure the `href` attribute correctly points to your CSS file's location.

5. **Add Content to the Body and Assign Classes**

   - In the `<body>` section, add HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, and divs.
   - Assign classes to elements as needed to apply the styles defined in your CSS file.
     - For example: `<p class="note">This is a note.</p>`

6. **Save and View Your Files**

   - Save your HTML file with a `.html` extension, such as `external-stylesheet.html`.
   - Save your CSS file as `styles.css`.
   - Ensure both files are in the same directory or adjust the `href` path in the `<link>` tag accordingly.
   - Open your HTML file in a web browser to see the styles applied from the external stylesheet.

### Exercise:

- **Task:** Enhance your webpage by adding styles through an external stylesheet.
- **Instructions:**
  - In `styles.css`, create styles for different HTML elements and classes.
  - Experiment with element selectors (e.g., `p`, `h1`), class selectors (e.g., `.alert`), and ID selectors (e.g., `#main-content`).
  - Apply classes and IDs to elements in your HTML file to see how they are styled.
  - Try adding responsive styles using media queries for different screen sizes.

---

### Summary

- **Inline Styles**: Use the `style` attribute directly on HTML elements for quick, unique styling.
- **Internal Styles with Class Selectors**: Utilize the `<style>` tag and class selectors to apply consistent styles to multiple elements within the same HTML document.
- **External Stylesheets**: Keep your CSS in a separate `.css` file linked to your HTML document for better organization and reusability.

By practicing these methods independently, you'll gain a solid understanding of how to style web pages using CSS. Feel free to experiment with different properties and selectors in each task to see how they affect your HTML content.

Happy coding!
